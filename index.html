                been planning to work on my coding skills and learn new stuff but have been super lazy and not
                interested to do it, somehow managed to push myself to atleast do something. havent coded since march
                2020 or something like that
            </p>
            <p>
                i thought it would be cool to have a spot where i just ramble on this page whilst its being built
            </p>
            <p>
                created a simple repo today, reinstalled ubuntu cli and node.js and updated git.
                i did run into an issue where i couldnt actually clone my repo lol - turns out windows wasn't up to
                date which prevented it (i think?)
            </p>
            <p>
                then i just used a html boilerplate which had some things <a href="javascript:void(0);">i didnt really
                    understand<span class="tooltip">also didnt bother to search up on, maybe next time
                        though?</span></a>. and then speed
                built a standard page with virtually no complex skills required.
            </p>
            <p>
                threw in a random colour scheme that i got from <a
                    href="https://coolors.co/011627-fdfffc-2ec4b6-e71d36-ff9f1c">coolors.co</a> - the scheme is linked
                in that url too; probably used it awfully but that's okay
            </p>
            <p>
                think i'll do some design work in adobe xd before i continue with this page - but first i need to
                figure out how to host this thing using github and use www.arazez.com as a <a
                    href="javascript:void(0);">vanity<span class="tooltip">(i think thats the right term to
                        use?)</span></a> url
            </p>
            <p>
                not much but atleast its a start - i think thats okay
            </p>

        <div class="row" id="blog-title">
            <p>
                made a decision

        <div class="row" id="blog-content">
            <p>
                decided to use material design guidelines and will build it using semantic UI
            </p>
            <p>
                wanted to try design the entire site before actually coding at all - but it became such a long and
                tedious process that i'm going to stop
            </p>
            <p>
                heres a picture of what i did in figma anyway though
            </p>
            <img src="figma.PNG" max-width="600px" />
            <p>
                will probably be using webpack to help with the construction and development environment whilst building the website
            </p>
            <p>
                i've also decided to change my colour scheme (which will probably change 100 times again) <a
                    href="https://coolors.co/000000-14213d-fca311-e5e5e5-ffffff">it looks like this now</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                anyway will start the development process when i can be bothered - hopefully next blog post will be a more flattering page with cleaner code - a "page in construction thing or something like that"
            </p>
            <p>
                so far its looking to be a fun project
            </p>
