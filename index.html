                been planning to work on my coding skills and learn new stuff but have been super lazy and not
                interested to do it, somehow managed to push myself to atleast do something. havent coded since march
                2020 or something like that
            </p>
            <p>
                i thought it would be cool to have a spot where i just ramble on this page whilst its being built
            </p>
            <p>
                created a simple repo today, reinstalled ubuntu cli and node.js and updated git.
                i did run into an issue where i couldnt actually clone my repo lol - turns out windows wasn't up to
                date which prevented it (i think?)
            </p>
            <p>
                then i just used a html boilerplate which had some things <a href="javascript:void(0);">i didnt really understand<span class="tooltip">also didnt bother to search up on, maybe next time though?</span></a>. and then speed
                built a standard page with virtually no complex skills required.
            </p>
            <p>
                threw in a random colour scheme that i got from <a
                    href="https://coolors.co/011627-fdfffc-2ec4b6-e71d36-ff9f1c">coolors.co</a> - the scheme is linked
                in that url too; probably used it awfully but that's okay
            </p>
            <p>
                think i'll do some design work in adobe xd before i continue with this page - but first i need to
                figure out how to host this thing using github and use www.arazez.com as a <a href="javascript:void(0);">vanity<span
                        class="tooltip">(i think thats the right term to use?)</span></a> url
            </p>
            <p>
                not much but atleast its a start - i think thats okay
            </p>
